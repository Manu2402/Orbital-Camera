# Orbital Camera

A small 3D project where the player controls an **Ivysaur** using **WASD**, the **mouse**, and the **mouse wheel**.  
The core of the project is a smooth and responsive **orbital camera system**, which keeps the Pokémon at the center of focus while allowing free exploration of the scene.  
This project was developed as a **final exam** for the **first year** of the *Video Game Programming* course at the **Accademia Italiana Videogiochi (AIV)**.  

## Features  
- Full **orbital camera** implementation around the character
